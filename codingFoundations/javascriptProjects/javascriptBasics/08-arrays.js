// Key Points Here are some key points: 
//•	Arrays can be stored by variables. 
//•	Use square brackets [] to surround the values in an array. 
//•	Separate items with commas within the brackets. 
//•	Can have a collection of one type  OR 
//•	Can assign multiple types:

var mySecretSpyInfo = ["James Bond", 007, true]; // A string, a number (although the 00 is ignored), and a boolean

// The 0 INDEX      The index of an array starts at 0.    
var countryArray = ["USA", "Japan", "Belgium"]; // 0        1        2

//ACCESS VALUES     Array values can be accessed by using bracket notation [] alongside the name of the array. Inside of the brackets you will put the number for the index position you want to select. Print the array values. 
console.log(countryArray[2]);  //What will print here?  "BELGIUM"
console.log(countryArray[0]);  //And here?      "USA"



//  MORE PRACTICE - Use the four arrays below to complete the challenges and print out the correct data.

let dogs = ["Shiba Inu", "Husky", "Corgi", "Great Dane"];
let cats = ["Maine Coon", "Bengal", "Siamese", "Sphynx"];
let birds = ["African Grey Parrot", "Canary", "Macaw", "Finch"];
let fish = ["Goldfish", "Neon Tetra", "Betta", "Guppy"];
//Print "Shiba Inu"
//Print the second value of the second array.
//Print "Guppy".
//Print the first value of the birds array.
