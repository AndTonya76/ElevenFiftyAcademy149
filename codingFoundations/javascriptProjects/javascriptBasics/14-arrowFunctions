//ARROW FUNCTIONS are not hoisted - intended to fix the problem where we need to access a property of this inside a callback.  New Version of JavaScript ES6 aka "Fat Arrow Function"

/*"concise" body (no curly braces... whatever is after "fat arrow" is automatically returned/ executed)

"block" body (include curly braces and explicityly need to "return" any data)
*/
//CONCISE BODY automatically execute example:

let speak = (noise) => console.log (`${noise}! ${noise}!`)
speak("Bark")// Output: Bark! Bark!

// - automatically return data after "fat arrow"
let showFullName = (first, last) => `${first} ${last}`

console.log(`Dude giving the lecture's name is ${showFullName("TJ", "Hindman")}`)// output: Dude giving the lecture's name is TJ Hindman

BLOCK BODY
//INCLUDE EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY (multiple line of code) BEORE SPECIFYING A "RETURN" VALUE
let speakAgain = (noise) => {
    let time = "later"

console.log(`${noise} ${time}! ${noise} ${time}!`)
}
speakAgain("Meow")
let showThisName = (first, last) => {
    `${first} ${last}`
}
showThisName("Tonya", "Anderson")
console.log(`Her name is ${showThisName("Tonya", "Anderson")}`)
/*Output: Meow later! Meow later!
Her name is undefined*/
